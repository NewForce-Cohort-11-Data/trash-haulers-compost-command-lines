This week on my trash day, Wednesday, I heard a loud sound in the alley - which was my garbage can being destroyed - either by the recycling truck, or the garbage truck.  They then left my trash behind.  It ripped the mud flap from the truck.  The mud flap left behind is laying on top of the crushed garbage can (and trash still inside)- all are still in the alley.  It was run over and the wheels/axel are broken.  My cart is always put away, except when I pull it to the edge on trash morning.  The can was not sitting in the alley-way;  It was pulled up to the edge.  As you can see by my yard, I am a very neat person, and keep our alley clean.  This is very upsetting.

Each week now, I watch and hear the trash truck roll down Carolyn picking up trash, then they turn onto Martha, back up to collect trash from this nearby houses then they pull forward on Martha, completely drive past my trash bins but go one house down to get theirs and another one.  Why does this happen and how can I get this corrected? And I also have to mention this trash truck is blaring loud music and it?s 7/7:30 in the morning and people are usually still sleeping.

I have requested in the past that the garbage cans be returned to an upright position and THE LIDS CLOSED! Leaving the lids open allows for mosquitoes to breed freely and encourages rodents. 
If the cans were returned to their upright position and closed, this would cut down on the cost of maintaining the cans and the service. It would also help mitigate other expenses related to mosquito and rodent control.

We pray for rain to wash the stench and ""stains"" on the street after each trash pickup. I've been told that nothing can be done about the vile liquid. Last Wednesday, the trash truck also dropped solids as it traveled down my street. Those solids get eaten by wild animals, but are also eaten by household pets (dogs, cats, etc.). I'm hoping my dog doesn't get sick as a result. Last Wednesday, the trash truck also dropped broken glass as it traveled down the street. I've picked up between 50 and 100 pieces as I walked my dog, and I still see pieces on the ground days later. The glass is small enough to get caught in the paw of a dog or cat, and can cause injury. 
Why can't the trucks be ""sealed"" so they don't discharge the vile liquid, solids or broken glass? My neighbors and I want our trash picked up, but we don't appreciate the unnecessary side effects. I have samples of the glass if anyone cares to see them.

93274,2018-08-27,Trash Collection Complaint,Routinely our trash cans are not fully emptied by our collectors. We have another situation where at least one of them has not been fully emptied for 4-5 weeks now.

101005,2018-09-19,Trash Collection Complaint,"Hello,

I just tried calling but your phone lines are closed after 5pm.

I don't know why last week's Request was CLOSED.  My trash was never picked up ""within 1-3 business days"" from last Wed.  I left my trash bin out all week for it to be picked up, but it still wasn't.
 I received this email message on Monday (about my previous request being CLOSED, however I figured it was closed because trash pickup was SUPPOSED TO BE in two days again, meaning TODAY, Wednesday.  But that was not to be so!  I just arrived home from work and my trash has NOT been picked up... AGAIN!  This is the THIRD WEEK IN A ROW that trash along our alleyway has not been picked up!  I only reported it for last week's non-pickup. 

Attached are two photos I took just minutes ago (at 6:25 pm Wed 9/19/18) of the evidence that the trash bins have not been picked up.  The first pic is that of my neighbors, showing their trash bins overflowing.  The second pic is of my trash bin with several bags in it.  

My address is 310 - 37th Ave N, Nashville TN 37209 in Sylvan Heights.  The trash bins are located in the alley immediately east of 37th Ave and west of 35th Ave, between Elkins and Nevada Avenues.  What will it take to get our trash bins emptied, please?  Are you short handed for workers?  The garbage men we had before were really good, so I don't know what the problem is now.

Please do everything in your power to get these trash bins emptied in a timely manner, as it's making our neighborhood look trashy.

Thank you!

I am currently sick and can't go out to look) as is the one on the deck and the rest of the trash is either in bags on the deck (which is a mess now because I think they've had animals get in them) and in my kitchen. I do have a gate but it is always unlocked and open and going through it to get to my backyard has never been an issue before. But since I renewed the waiver I have yet to be able to get anyone to pick up at all. Please help!

It seems slightly counter intuitive that your truck picks up waste, only to leave more unconfined waste behind.

As you are well aware, this has happened numerous times on my property. I have kept a record of pictures and well as this paper trail of emails. 

I know that you guys always come to wash it, but that usually takes a few days. As those days pass, the stench of garbage lingers in front my house and me and my dog inevitably track this waste into the house since we are forced to walk through it. Also, kids play on this street daily, so they are also being exposed to it. It is disgusting, unsanitary, and undoubtably attracts bugs as well. This is not fair to me or anyone else on this street. 

Please contact whomever and make sure they come and clean this as soon as possible.

120883,2018-12-04,Damage to Property,"I have several pictures showing how your truck is also littering solid waste. It seems slightly counter intuitive that your truck picks up waste, only to leave more unconfined waste behind. The picture shows cigarette butts, Q-tips, mashed moist toilet paper, along with some other unidentifiable objects that will inevitable end up in my driveway. As you are well aware, this has happened numerous times on my property. I have kept a record of pictures and well as this paper trail of emails. 

I know that you guys always come to wash it, but that usually takes a few days. As those days pass, the stench of garbage lingers in front my house and me and my dog inevitably track this waste into the house since we are forced to walk through it. Also, kids play on this street daily, so they are also being exposed to it. It is disgusting, unsanitary, and undoubtably attracts bugs as well. This is not fair to me or anyone else on this street. 

Please contact whomever and make sure they come and clean this as soon as possible. Also, the series of power washes has started to uplift some of the concrete in my walkway, which will cause me more problems in the future.

There was nothing on the list of things not to be included (leaves, debris, etc.).  The only thing I can think of is a furnace filter that is cardboard but the interior is metal that I don't think is supposed to go in recycle.  There was a chickfilet bag containing the garbage from a meal.  It was basically garbage.  I also had a note on on my recycle.  The only thing I can figure is we did bag the paper from our shredder in a plastic garbage bag.  

I have gone through the list of acceptable and not and think we are abiding, but evidently someone thinks differently than I.  Can I have a place to go for more guidance or this is going to be a continual issue.

I pay taxes for this service and expect it to be picked up.

The buses are approximately 45ft, (13.7m) long This is a hazard for the child pedestrians walking to and from school as well as for the bus drivers. Please ask the crew to replace the cart from where they got it (out of the right-of-way)? The crews had been doing well for months (no complaints). Encourage them to tighten up and do-the-right thing. If they don't I'll have to complain every week and escalate the ticket to upper management. It takes less effort to put the cart away than to be negligent and cause traffic accidents or children ran over.

May you be Healthy and Safe!
May your Cart Crews be safe and professional.

I am taxpayer as everyone else and pay my dues diligently, however for being a good citizens and doing meticulous recycling seems that we are punished by not picked up trash.  Can you reduce our trash pick up fees? In addition, I do not use recycling card, but deliver all my recycled items to Green Hills location where I sort it out my recycling, as I feel this is so much better way to sort out. We been told by trash pick up workers that they dump recycling content from green cans in the landfill. In addition, our neighbors from 2003A Aswhood Ave trash was also not picked up today and they parked they cart before 7 am today.   Thank you for addressing this matter. Otherwise, I need to get my fees reduced for this particular service.  To add, if workers see that we are looking thru the window, or we are outside, they do empty our trash cart/can.   Also today our trash can lid was not closed, and same happened to the number of our neighbors (please see photos).  Not closed lids create issues during the rain. We do recognize the hard work city and workers provide, but requesting  improvement.","2003B Ashwood Ave, Nashville, TN 37212, United States",37212,METRO,9308,18,1731906.22849269,654559.598783595

I would enjoy if the crew would simply return the cart to where they got it from, off the street, not on the curb and beyond the sidewalk adjacent to the fire hydrant.  This location clears the street for school buses and the sidewalk for pedestrians. In addition ask them to close the lid on the cart.  All work is honorable and I have the utmost respect for their efforts but now the crew acts like they don't don't pay the supervisors or citizens any attention.

All prior trashtrucks and drivers took the time to return and safely lower the empty trashcans to upright position and make sure the lids were closed.  This is important due to rain and wear and tear on the trashcans.

212428,2019-07-09,Trash Collection Complaint,"Hello,
Writing in because I think the truck that came to my neighborhood may need some attention. As soon as I turned onto 28th Ave N. coming home from work, I smelled trash liquid. If you look at the location of my house, you can see a drive that separates the two rows of homes. That's where we put out the carts on trash day. There was a clear trail of stinky trash liquid running the length of that drive with puddles where the truck must have paused. On those puddles, flies were gathering so they were definitely the source of the smell. I did my best to dilute and hose away the puddles and trails but I couldn't get it all and I certainly couldn't wash up the street. -- I don't know much at all about how garbage trucks work but I don't think they're supposed to leak garbage water like that. 

Please have the truck cleaned/repaired before next week if possible. 

Thank you and have a good day,

236115,2019-08-22,Trash Collection Complaint,"With no warning, our neighborhood was removed from Metro's garbage pickup route. I am a resident in Green Hills Terrace. Up until recently, all condos/cottages had garbage pickup. No recycling pickup, so I bring ALL my recycling to the nearby dropoff and hand sort it all-- but that's content for another letter I guess. 

What happened is this. A week and a half ago, on Wed the 14th, everyone is the neighborhood put their trash out. Now, on the 22nd, all that trash is still out. Not picked up. Our neighborhood manager finally got a response that we were removed from Metro's route because apparently condos are not included in trash pickup anymore. 

What I want to know is this. First, who made that decision? Who can I contact about this? Second, I would like to know why our complex was not told that this issue would happen.

As a young person living in Nashville often I feel that I have no way to be heard by local government. I have written multiple letters about various issues in town and never received any answers. I would like to have a conversation with someone about this. 

Thank you for your time!

246532,2019-09-13,Trash Collection Complaint,"For the last several weeks, the trash truck driver has been quiet rough with the trash cans but somewhat destructive with our property. Several weeks now many of us have to retrieve our trash cans out of the street as well as  them being turned over. Today the driver slammed my can down really hard, sent the can flying then he ran over it. The driver doesn?t wait for the items to fall from the can but flips it up and them back down with no hesitation to allow all the trash bags to travel from the bottom of the can. I have picked up trash for weeks now that falls from the truck while he is picking up my trash. The truck appears to be too full so when he adds items  many items fall off the truck. I just recommend the driver receive additional training. I realize the city will replace damaged trash cans but it is at us taxpayers expense. If you need more information, I can reach me at 901-494-8518.  Thanks for any assistance  Patsy Burns","2521 PENNINGTON BEND RD, 101, 37214",37214,RED RIVER,1501,15,1761362.5680663,693212.448253989
