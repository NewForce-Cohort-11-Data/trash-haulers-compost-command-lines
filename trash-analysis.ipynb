    "## Missed Trash Pickups\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data question you will be working data of service request related to missed trash pickups from hubNashville, Metro Nashville government's comprehensive customer service system (https://hub.nashville.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of Metro's contract with Red River Waste Solutions, failure to remedy an action or inaction will result in liquidated damages. One category of liquidated damages is related to chronic problems in any category of service at the same premises. A chronic problem is defined as more than one missed pickup for any address. The first missed pickup will not result in a fine; however, every subsequent missed pickup will result in a $200 fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to determine the total amount of damages due to missed pickups. Note that not all rows that you have been provided correspond to missed pickups and that you will need to ensure that you are only counting missed pickups.\n",
    "\n",
    "After determining the total amount of damages, you can look at other questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What other types of complaints are there?\n",
    "* Make a heat map that shows the most total missed pick ups and another that shows the total fines, each by zip code.\n",
    "* How do metro crews compare to the contractor's performance?\n",
    "* How much does each trash hauler owe?\n",
    "* What were to total missed pickup by route?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, explore the data.  Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis is an important and necessary step.  \n",
    "Planning and communication are vital to success. This data and analysis are based on a real-world project."
