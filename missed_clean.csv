78081,2018-06-26,Trash Collection Complaint,"This is my second complaint in the past three years I have at this address . The complaint was originally resolved and now the issue is back again:

For the past few months, the trash man HAS NOT emptied the entire bin & HAS NOT closed the lid to the bin. They do not pick up the bin and dump it, instead, they open the lid and pull bags out and then leave with the lid open.

FOR MONTHS, this trash bag and house vent have been in my trash bin. People who walk the alleys throw their trash (bottles, etc.) in bins (as you can see via the image). They also throw their dog bags of feces. THEN, when it rains, because the lid was left WIDE OPEN, it collects water. The water mixes with the feces and it BECOMES A BREEDING GROUND for insects, especially misquotes. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.  It is unacceptable that the trash man does not (1) dump the ENTIRE bin nor (2) close the lid. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT MY BIN IS DUMPED IN FULL FOR TOMORROW's PICK-UP. The bin has become disgusting. I used to clean it myself the first year; however, this should not be an issue.

Sincerely,

Anna Kathleen Garr

This problem has been happening since Waste Management has taken over from McMurtery Waste.  I have asked the driver not to back down the driveway, however he continues to do so.  My driveway has been stone since 1938.  Driver has repeatedly missed the driveway and has driven up on my lawn.  He is within inches of hitting two 300 year old trees.  I have been nice so far and not reported him.  This must stop.  After he ran into the ditch, he backed out leaving ruts in my yard and never collected my trash!  I am requesting a supervisor to come out and assess the damage and schedule repair.  There is not excuse for this sloppiness and disrespect for a homeowner's property",4316 Brush Hill Rd,37216,RED RIVER,2203,7,1757819.99937536,692461.198880841

148208,2019-02-27,Trash - Backdoor,I am highly upset with this service. I can see why it?s FREE!!!! I wouldn?t dare pay my hard earned money for this service. My senior citizen mom has back yard service. This would be the 2nd time that this  mistake has happen for not getting her back yard trash. I don?t give too craps if your low/ on staff or new hires and their  forgetting to pick up her trash in the back. Or is it the fact that their lazy to do the job? It?s been  several occasions where I came to  visit and her can wasn?t push back in it?s  original backyard spot and I had to do it. What if my mother didn?t have  children? Who would take the  initiative to roll her bin back? The  garbage workers could care less. I shouldn?t have to call or place tickets regarding trash!!!! This is  Ludacris!!!! They forgot to pick up her trash last  Wednesday so they came  Tuesday.  Wednesday Is her  original pick up day. Just because they came on Tuesday is NOT!! An excuse to not come on her  original pick up day!!!! She still had more trash for pick-up. Now this whole trash  schedule is out of order. Why do you offer this service if you can?t own up to this job? This is the last time that this matter is going to happen!!! I will be paying a visit to the  supervisor and more!!!!!! I know it?s the two lady?s that Handels the claim ticket process and I think one of them is name Cindy? Whoever it is please process my mom ticket for this trash And getting this route back on track... 617 Kinsey Blvd Madison TN 37115,215 6Th Ave N,37219,RED RIVER,3314,19,1737607.39869743,666925.600335822

The street on Brantly on one side was not collected. Then as I turned onto Mossdale Rd were I saw the truck out late last night it looked like the truck only picked up trash from every other house. Something is terrible wrong in how they pick up trash on friday. My trash is currently full and I might have to take it myself somewhere.  They have been coming later and later lately now not even picking it up at all. Not good!,2929 Lera Jones Dr,37013,RED RIVER,3505,29,1786855.74995217,634534.780272884

The first incident was closed indicating that my bin was not on the curb (per the worker), which is ridiculous.  I work from home now, so I heard the truck go up the street - when I looked, the trash bin was lifted but the bin was not emptied.  I have pictures of the bin and how it was placed back on my land, as well as my neighbors - one who's bin is on the grass (like mine) and one who's bin was emptied from the driveway.  My bin has been almost demolished by this worker as well -  when it rains, my bin floods.  I understand normal wear and tear, but these episodes are making me question why this is occurring with no action by Public Works.  

I am soliciting your assistance in not only having consistent trash pick up (my bin is awaiting pickup due to two escalated ticket requests - 188904 and 188849.

Thank you!  I have pictures that I'd like to provide as well.  Unfortunately I can only load one, but I have three pictures to share if there is a dispute that my bin was on the curb, once again.",247 Ash Grove Dr,37211,RED RIVER,4404,31,1761029.52328642,624934.6452727

I am on the Board of directors for our Homeowners Association. The driver is obviously bypassing our complex as it is evident the next day that individual homes with driveways with garbage cans all along the remainder of Golf Club Lane are picked up.   I am enclosing a photo of the sign for our complex on Golf Club Lane.   It is also terribly inefficient to follow Metro rules that every homeowner in Gloucester square report non-pick up of our trash when this happens.  It also means that no one in management is addressing the systemic issue here.  I have left voice mail messages for supervisor Marcus Jackson this morning and one  for a previous incident.    I would like some confirmation from management that this bigger issue is being addressed with the collection team that services our neighborhood.   I can be reached at 703-615-5949.

I am on the Board of directors for our Homeowners Association. The driver is obviously bypassing our complex as it is evident the next day that individual homes with driveways with garbage cans all along the remainder of Golf Club Lane are picked up.   I am enclosing a photo of the sign for our complex on Golf Club Lane.   It is also terribly inefficient to follow Metro rules that every homeowner in Gloucester square report non-pick up of our trash when this happens.  It also means that no one in management is addressing the systemic issue here.  I have left voice mail messages for supervisor Marcus Jackson this morning and one  for a previous incident.    I would like some confirmation from management that this bigger issue is being addressed with the collection team that services our neighborhood.   I can be reached at 703-615-5949.

My trash is still here ( I'm disabled and it is difficult to take containers down my driveway.  When I went down today to pull it back up, I found my trash was not collected).  I called my next door neighbor and they stated their two containers were not emptied yesterday either.  I usually hear and see the trash truck go down our street and then come back up.  My neighbor indicated the same and neither of us saw or heard the truck yesterday.
The recycling truck DID come.thru and collect yesterday.
We have trash that carries odors and it is not good to have it sitting for another week.
If the truck will be coming around to collect, please have someone.call me so I'm able to get the container back down the driveway.

In fact, it was picked up today at 4:09 PM.  One FULL DAY LATE.  This is totally unacceptable.  Animals could easily get into the curby and make an awful mess.  
This is my second complaint this summer about this service.  This summer is the first time since the curby program was instituted that we've had any problems.  Now it seems like problems are the new normal.  
SOMETHING needs to be done.  This must be corrected.

240712,2019-08-31,Trash - Curbside/Alley Missed Pickup,"My garbage was not picked up yesterday.  I have video surveillance  cameras that show every street location of all the neighbor garbage cans.  I went back on the video and saw that every can within site of my cameras were emptied except mine.  The driver drove by my two cans twice, within 10 to 12 feet of them,  without ever slowing down.  He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone's cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn't empty mine.  His answer was ""Oh, I guess I didn't see them"".  Isn't that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.  Yeah Tuesday, because of the holiday I guess all pick up people are off.  If the cans are not picked up by Tuesday I'll be calling my councilman and asking for an investigation.  I'll be saving the surveillance footage for anyone who cares to see it can.",89 Riverpoint Pass,37214,RED RIVER,1503,15,1773181.83083379,669295.671730352

We recently purchased this property and the seller/former owner of the home unfortunately used recycling containers as their trash cans. We put signs on the cans Thursday evening prior to Friday's trash pick up trying to help identify that the items in the bins were trash and not recycling. Also, since we are moving, unpacking, etc. we have some items next the cans that need to be picked up as trash. Once we have a clean slate and everything is picked up, we will be able to dispose of trash and recycling as desired. Currently, we don't have any room to put anything other than on the ground next to the cans. 

Thank you,

This means I have to just leave the trash bin by the road and hope that the trash collection service decides to grace us and pick up the trash bin.

Is there any solution to this problem or are we just at the whim of when the trash collectors decide to grace us with their presence.",1101 Saunders Ave,37115,RED RIVER,3214,8,1753790.99851103,699195.399551886
